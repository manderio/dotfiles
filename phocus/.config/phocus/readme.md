### phocus directory
Hi there!

This directory requires you to go to my lovely friend phisch's github and download phocus as well as setting it up.

He got all instructions there, I found that the git installation works best for me!

also, give him some hugs and cat gifs while you're there, the old boomer deserves some love!
